# Strategic Model of H2 Adoption in Aviation

A game theoretic model of network effects in the adoption of hydrogen-based aircraft and infrastructure by airlines and airports for NASA's Convergent Aeronautical Solutions (CAS) discovery team. The primary goal is to build a model of adoption of the technologies necessary to increase hydrogen-based flight that accounts for individual rationality of players and their response to strategic interpendence.
